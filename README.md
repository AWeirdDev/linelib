  # Optimized Source Code.
  Cleaner source code is beneficial because it is easier to read, understand, and maintain. It's easier for you to add new features, fix bugs, and understand how the code works. Clean code is also more efficient, as it is optimized for performance and is less likely to contain errors or bugs. It is also more reusable, allowing you to use it in other projects without having to rewrite it.
