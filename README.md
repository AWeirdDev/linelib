# ðŸ§¹ Say No More To Unorganized Code.

LINELIB has one of the best tools like events and action handlers, which saves you a lot of time!

Let's say you have a postback action, but you DON'T want another `if` statement to handle all of the action postbacks at once...

> **JUST TRY OUT ACTION HANDLERS!**<br>â€” The Wise Man

```py
def someEvent(...):
  action = New.PostbackAction(...)

  # Check This Out!
  @action.handle()
  def handleIt(ctx):
    ctx.reply("Responding to actions has never been easier like this.")
```

## ...with âœ¨ DATA STORAGE âœ¨!
Data storage helps you to identify a user, or store a pre-built function to execute next.

> **Everything. You can store EVERYTHING.**<br>â€” Also The Wise Man

```py
def stuff():
  print("I like cheeseburger")

action = New.PostbackAction(..., remember="a user", and_do=stuff)

@action.handle()
def handleIt(ctx, remember, and_do):
  #               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  #                simple as that.
  ctx.reply("I remember you: " + remember)
  and_do()
```

# ðŸ¤– All, automated.
LINELIB uses `flask` to open the magic portal of HTTP.

#### ~~Configuring webservers,<br> Managing Data,<br> Understanding LINE API Responses,~~
## ðŸ’» Just Concentrate on Coding.
Hosting webservers, managing data, understanding how LINE API works... Say no more! LINELIB does all of that â€” Just for you.

Just look how **clean** using LINELIB Client:

```py
client = linelib.Client("channel secret", "channel access token")
```

...that's it. That's all you need to code. 

What about Flask Servers? Handlers?<br>Long Story Short, **we did it all for you.**

# ðŸš€ The Journey Awaits.
Let's just get started.

```py
client.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
```
