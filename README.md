  ## âœ¨ Optimized Source Code.
  Cleaner source code is beneficial because it is easier to read, understand, and maintain. It's easier for you to add new features, fix bugs, and understand how the code works. Clean code is also more efficient, as it is optimized for performance and is less likely to contain errors or bugs. It is also more reusable, allowing you to use it in other projects without having to rewrite it.

# ðŸŽ‰ Examples.
"Don't just talk. Show me some examples!" I hear you say...

## 1: Quick Example
```py
from linelib import Client

client = Client('channel secret', 'channel access token')

@client.event('ready')
async def ready():
  print('I am ready!')
  
client.run()
```

## 2: LINE Notify Example
```py
from linelib import Client
from linelib.notify import Notify

client = Client('channel secret', 'channel access token')
notify = Notify("access token")

@client.event('ready')
async def ready():
  await notify.notify("Daily News:\nLinelib version 2 has released!!11!")
  
client.run()
```

## 3: Simple Command Cog
This is a simple cog with the command "hello", which requires one argument (times) in order to work.

User: `hello 10`

Bot: `You greeted me 10 times!`

```py
from linelib import Client
from linelib.ext import commands

client = Client('channel secret', 'channel access token')

class MyCog(commands.Cog):
  @commands.cog_command(name="hello")
  async def greet_command(self, ctx, times: int):
    # "self" is required!
    await ctx.reply(f"You greeted me {times} times!")

client.load_cog(MyCog())
client.run()
```

## 4: Advanced Command Cog
This is a more advanced command cog with command rules, and rule rejection handlers.

The command (say) requires one argument "text", but you should add a "*" in the `greet_command` coroutine function to tell linelib to pass the rest of the message content into the argument ("text").

User: `say I love chocolate!`

Bot: `I love chocolate!`

1 second later...

User: `say I still love it.`

Bot: `The cooldown is 10 seconds long! Please wait.`

```py
from linelib import Client
from linelib.ext import commands, rule

client = Client('channel secret', 'channel access token')

class MyCog(commands.Cog):
  @commands.cog_command(
    name="say",
    rule=rule.CommandRule(
      rule="cooldown",
      seconds=10
    )
  )
  async def greet_command(self, ctx, *, text):
    # "self" is required!
    await ctx.reply(text)
    
  @greet_command.rule_reject
  async def rejected(self, ctx):
    await ctx.reply('The cooldown is 10 seconds long! Please wait.')

client.load_cog(MyCog())
client.run()
```

## 5: Custom Rule (Advanced)
Custom rules must have a function named "handler". The handler must return a valid boolean (`True` or `False`).

`True` represents that the user is able to use the command, vice versa.
```py
from linelib.ext import rule

class MyRule(rule.CommandRule):
  def handler(self, ctx):
    # ... your awesome code
    return True # must return True or False
    
MyRule(rule="based.custom") # Now, it's a valid command rule.
```
