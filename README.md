  <summary><h1>v2.2 coming out SOON!</h1></summary>
  <p>

Soon, we'll roll out the latest linelib update (`v2.2`) with bug fixes, and make your bots work more efficient. In addition, we're also putting back your favorite (probably) command cogs, but with better updates and features! Let's take a peek!

# üì¢ New: Command Cogs!
With the latest update, commands and cogs will soon replace literally every single text handler! 

Let's see what we can do with them! üòà

## ‚öôÔ∏è Simple Cog
The program below is a simple cog that greets you whenever you say `hello`:
```py
# version 2.2 (PREVIEW)
from linelib.ext import commands

class MyCog(commands.Cog):
  # cog_command MUST be in a cog:
  @commands.cog_command(name="hello")
  async def say_hello(self, ctx):
    await ctx.send("Hello, World!")
```

## üì¶ ...with arguments & error handlers!
```py
# version 2.2 (PREVIEW)
from linelib import MissingArgument

# (inside a cog)
@commands.cog_command(name="drink")
async def drink(self, ctx, bottles: int):
  await ctx.send(f'You drank {bottles} of water!')

@drink.on_error
async def error_handler(self, ctx, error):
  if isinstance(error, MissingArgument): # missing a parameter ('bottles')
    await ctx.send('You missed some parameters!')
  else:
    raise error # if this error is something else...
```

## üîë Command not found? I got you covered!
```py
# version 2.2 (PREVIEW)

class MyCog(commands.Cog):
  ...
  
  async def not_found(self, ctx, command):
    print(f"Command {command} not found!")
```

# üìñ New: Command Rules!
Command rules help you to add rules to your commands which help you easily to detect if the users have the permission to use this command or not.

Even further, it is possible to modify it with ‚ú® command cooldowns! ‚ú®

```py
# DECLARATION, DO NOT COPY
def __init__(self, *, rule: Literal["cooldown", "except", "for", "based.custom", "usage_limit"], **variations) -> None
```

## ü•∂ Command Cooldowns & Rejects
```py
# version 2.2 (PREVIEW)
from linelib.ext import commands, rule

# (inside a cog)
@commands.cog_command(
  name="command",
  rule=rule.CommandRule(
    rule="cooldown",
    seconds=10
  )
)
async def my_command(self, ctx):
  await ctx.send('Hello!')
  
@my_command.rule_reject
async def rule_rejected(self, ctx):
  await ctx.send('You just greeted me!\nThe cooldown is 10 seconds long.')
```

# üòé Load the Cog like a Pro
```py
client.load_cog(MyCog())
```

That's it! We also added some other features that are pretty stunning besides these! :)

  ## ‚ú® Optimized Source Code.
  Cleaner source code is beneficial because it is easier to read, understand, and maintain. It's easier for you to add new features, fix bugs, and understand how the code works. Clean code is also more efficient, as it is optimized for performance and is less likely to contain errors or bugs. It is also more reusable, allowing you to use it in other projects without having to rewrite it.
