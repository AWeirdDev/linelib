# FAD - Simple
👋 Hey, there! Welcome to your (very first) tutorial. I'm your guide. 

And certainly, I'd guide you to finish a Linelib Project for restaurants... in a simple way as promised. 😉

## Let's setup the environment.
To get started, installing the library is definitely a required step. 🥶

```ruby
$ pip install -U linelib
```

This installs the latest version of Linelib, and we're good to go!

Also, you'll need a **Python Code Editor**. I highly recommend you to **use [Replit](https://replit.com)**.
